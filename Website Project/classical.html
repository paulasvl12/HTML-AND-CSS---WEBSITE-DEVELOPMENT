  <h1>Classical </h1>
  <p> Classical music is a very general term which normally refers to the standard 
  music of countries in the Western world. ... It is music that has been composed by 
  musicians who are trained in the art of writing music (composing) and written down 
  in music notation so that other musicians can play it. More specifically, music
   written in the European tradition during a period lasting approximately from 1750 
   to 1830, when forms such as the symphony, concerto, and sonata were standardized.</p>
  
  <h2> Characteristics </h2>
  <p>a universal characteristic of classical music written since the late 13th century 
  is the invariable appliance of a standardized system of 
  precise mensural notation (which evolved into modern bar notation after 1600) for all
   compositions and their accurate performance. Another is the creation and 
   development of complex pieces of solo instrumental works (e.g., the fugue). 
   The first symphonies were produced during the Classical period; beginning in the 
   mid 18th century, the symphony ensemble and the compositions became prominent features 
   of Classical-period music. </p>
